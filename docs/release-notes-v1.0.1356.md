# TVRenamer v1.0.1356

## New features / improvements
- **Session-only Move toggle on the main screen**
  - You can now toggle Move on/off for the current run without changing saved Preferences.
  - Useful for temporarily doing rename-only processing without digging into settings.

- **Preferences → Matching table layout polish**
  - The “Overrides” and “Disambiguations” tables now start with a fixed status/icon column and split the remaining width evenly between the two text columns, so the tables fill their available space more neatly.
